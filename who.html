Oliver Kellhammer is a Canadian land artist, permaculture teacher, activist and writer. His botanical interventions and public art projects demonstrate nature's surprising ability to recover from damage. His work facilitates the processes of environmental regeneration by engaging the botanical and socio-political underpinnings of the landscape, taking such forms as small-scale urban eco-forestry, inner city community agriculture and the restoration of eroded railway ravines.His process is essentially anti-monumental - as his interventions integrate into the ecological and cultural communities that form around them, his role as artist becomes increasingly obscured. He describes what he does as a kind of catalytic model-making, which lives on as a vehicle for community empowerment while demonstrating methods of positive engagement with the global environmental crisis. Recent articles include:'Violent Reactions' an account of his father's life while working in a plastic factory and  'Neo-Eocene' where he makes the case for the reintroduction of prehistoric ecosystems as a strategy for adapting to climate change. His short story 'Crush,' which explores such realms as bioluminescent deep sea fishes and Japanese model train porn was nominated for the 2010 Canadian National Magazine Award.
