HOW DO WE SURVIVE?

For the first time in human history, the weather is about us.  The old witticism long attributed to Mark Twain—“Everyone talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it”—isn’t so funny anymore.  And it isn’t even true anymore, because of course now a lot of people are trying to do something about the weather. Climate change is—at long last—on the geopolitical agenda, if only in time for us to realize —as many fear—that it’s too late to do anything meaningful.  But the change of fortune suffered by Twain’s joke shouldn’t obscure—indeed, might even reveal—its canny conceptual architecture.  The joke deploys a familiar old binary: theory versus practice, talk-the-talk versus walk-the-walk, yammering away versus fixing things.  But it quickly turns the implied preference for one (doing) over the other (talking) on its head, locating a subject (the weather) that lies beyond practical intervention.  Maybe the problem is not that no one has been doing anything about the weather (nothing can be done) but that they’ve been talking about it in the wrong way: the old “let’s fix it” way.  And now, now that the weather’s changed, it’s also time to change the way we talk about it.  

Survival Challenges began with a commitment to find a new way to talk about the weather.  Very quickly, we found ourselves in the company of others—many, many others—who had grown impatient with the denial and delay around the subject, and wanted to propel the conversation, and the imagination, into the present time of climate change, to redesignate the “looming” crisis as one that’s here already.  We also quickly discovered one point of divergence between what we were looking for and what the “survival community” was finding.  We needed a different vocabulary from the one that animated their efforts: instead of crisis and catastrophe, we needed the familiar and ordinary; instead of desperation and heroism we needed playfulness and friendliness.   Our original point of entry—“Surviving Climate Change”—began shifting gears, becoming more mundane.   It became “Meeting Climate Change,” which conjured for us ideas of encounter and acquaintance rather than assault and capitulation.  

Also, instead of imagining mass movements, or even calling for community action, we were interested—perhaps perversely—in locating a new, more personal modality with regard to climate change.  Recalling the Sixties counter-culture mantra, “the personal is political,” we wondered if this particular politics—the politics of climate change—had evaded the personal for too long?  We were well aware, of course, of the long-standing discourse of personal responsibility in the environmental movement: the injunctions to practice simplicity, to recycle paper and plastic, to avoid waste and reduce consumption.  This entirely salutary discourse seemed, however, to skirt the deeper realms of the personal, realms of pleasure, fantasy, fear, affect, sensation, vision, imagination.  

One source for this kind of personal engagement with climate change could be such techniques of consciousness as meditation and mindfulness, which some of us had practiced, seriously and long.  While recognizing how much these techniques would themselves have to change in the context of climate change, we were nevertheless inspired by the deep injunction to friendliness embedded in them.  They gave us the second “movement” of our project: “Befriending Climate Change.” Once you meet climate change, you inevitably invite it into your mental environs.  After that, it’s only a matter of time before you get to know it better.  

The third “grammar” of our new weather language turned out to be “Becoming Climate Change.”  The imagination gets seriously involved now, the conversation deepens, the plot thickens.  Being hospitable—truly hospitable—involves opening oneself to the unknown, and the gifts of the guest can change the host profoundly.  “Becoming Climate Change” is our way of taking up the challenge posed by the new weather: to understand our human selves in ways that go beyond biography, even beyond history.  Our time, the Anthropocene, requires us to think of humanity as a geophysical force.  To accomplish this conceptual feat will need many kinds of imagination, beyond the imagination of crisis and catastrophe. As we look for a new way to talk about the weather, the language we’re finding suggests a conceptual nudge rather than a paradigm shift. In “Survival Challenges,” we’re seeing what the imagination of the everyday has to offer.  Once full of idle chatter “about the weather,” the everyday is now being reshaped by it.
