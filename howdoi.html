How do you unleash yourself?

Dear Climate is a project with many incarnations.

Comprised of 68 posters and 6 audio works to date, the work is designed to flex its nimble agitation/meditation muscles in a variety of urban and urbane formats.

We prefer the abject, provocative, strange, and lonely: A windswept street. A drift of papers, layers of peeling posters; headphones dangling from inside the janitorâ€™s closet.

Dear Climate might find its way into an alleyway or a gallery, as a graffiti-walled midnight wheat-paste operation, or as a mysterious alien listening pod floating in a city park pond. It could be printed out of your computer and dropped from an airplane, or it might appear disguised as an outhouse adjacent to a museum gallery.

The posters can be printed from your computer, hung up in your workplace cafeteria or school lunchroom, sheet- mulched into your neighborhood carbon capturing food forest or slipped into the magazine rack at a freeway filling station.

The podcasts may be used for group meditations at weddings, picnics, concerts, sports events, raves and retreats, or you might enjoy them while lying in your bathtub (empty or full).
