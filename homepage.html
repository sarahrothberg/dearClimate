Dear Climate, 

We really blew it. We're sorry. We had other ideas and 
forgot about finitude. 

But we're trying. 

These broadsheets, really just bits of paper, are our 
missives, our small odes of affection and awe, and our 
self-helpful hints that have been scattered by your 
whirlwinds. They are our apologies, our jests and 
protests, our bright ideas, bad ideas, and mental 
quick fixes. We'd like to make amends, to start by 
shifting relations: with you, with other species, and 
with our own tempestuous, impetuous inner climates, too. 

We hope you're still listening, and that you'll 
appreciate that we’re trying to cultivate a new imagination.

If you’ll accept them, dear Climate, these offerings will 
seal our promise to meet the terrors ahead and build the 
tolerances they will demand. 

Love, 
Marina, Oliver, Fritz and Una
