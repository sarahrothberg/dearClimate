      Dear Climate,
      <br>
      <br>
      We really blew it. We're sorry. We had other ideas and forgot about finitude.
      <br>
      <br>
      But we're trying. 
      <br>
      <br>
      These broadsheets, really just bits of paper, are our missives, our small odes of affection and awe, and our self-helpful hints that have been scattered by your whirlwinds. They are our apologies, our jests and protests, our bright ideas, bad ideas, and mental quick fixes. We'd like to make amends, to start by shifting relations: with you, with other species, and with our own tempestuous, impetuous inner climates, too.
      <br>
      <br>
      We hope you're still listening, and that you'll appreciate that we’re trying to cultivate a new imagination. 
      <br>
      <br>
      If you’ll accept them, dear Climate, these offerings will seal our promise to meet the terrors ahead and build the tolerances they will demand. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Love,
      <br>
      Marina, Oliver, Fritz and Una
